Create more .md files like this one as needed. Place them into the same folder as this [user_stories](./) folder. <br> 
Make sure to keep all versions of the user story here as well (if and when they change).

# User story title | e.g. `Show current deals`
User stories: A title that describes one thing the software needs to do for the customer.
> - Write using language that the user can understand (no IT acronyms or sayings).
> - Written from the customer’s point of view.
> - Each user story can only represent a *single* feature alone.
> - Make a very short, few word `title`.

---

## Description | e.g. `The web page will show current deals to 'Orion's orbits' users`
Write down a brief description of what the user story (feature) will accomplish within the context of the client's requested software.
> - Keep a running version history of descriptions, so that your instructor can see your changes easily. 
> - In a real project, older versions could be viewed via commits.
> - Format: `Description-Version`: `Description`
> - E.g. Description-v1: The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

Description-v`_`: *Your description goes here*

---

## Priority | `Range` & `Iteration` (See instructions below)
> - Range including 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 (10=significant, 50=least significant).
> - Each user story should belong to an iteration where it is intended to be developed and shipped. The exact date is to be decided as a team later.

**Range**: *Your range goes here*<br>
**Iteration**: *Your iteration goes here*

**Notes:** <br>
Any notes you have on why you selected your chosen priority go here. For example...
> - Did you think it was easy?
> - Is this a foundational feature?
> - How important was this to the client? etc.
- *Your notes goes here*
- ...
 
(Please keep in mind that you may have different priorities at different stages of your project. Again, keep all changes here for marking purposes.

## Estimation | `number of days` (See instructions below)
This step is to be completed without the client and instead as a development team. You must now share how long each member estimates each user story (feature) to implement. <br>
This is done by playing a *'Planning Poker'* game, where everyone selects an amount of time they believe a feature will take to implement. Rules:
> - Everyone must reveal their selection at the same time.
> - `number of days` can span from (1-100) days.
> - Any amount of days over 50 indicates that a team member is requesting the assumptions to be checked.
> - If the average of all team members' selections is over 15 days, the user story will likely need to be broken down into smaller logical parts.

**Assumptions:**
Write down your assumptions related to implementing the feature that could alter how long it takes, before making an overall time estimate.
- *Your assumptions goes here*
- ...

**Planning Poker:**
All notes related to overall time estimates go here. Keep a log of your *'Planning Poker'* games here.
> Format: `Team member name`: `estimate` (`iteration)` <br>
> Bob: 1 day (Iteration 1)
- Casey: X days (Iteration X)  
- Damon: X days (Iteration x)  
- Daniel: X days (Iteration X)
- Harrison: X days (Iteration X)  
**Average:** `_` days 

--------------------------

## Tasks
> E.g. "Research and integrate mapping API — 2 days"
1. Task 1 - Estimation `_` days
2. ...

## UI Design | Use guide in `major_components_designs` (Put copy in both locations)
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

---

## Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of the completed feature's implementation. 
* If you have multiple versions (between several iterations), show them all below.
