# Request Time Off

## Description

As a cleaner, I want to mark when I'm unavailable, so people can't schedule me while I am away.

---

## Priority 

**Range**: 30 (Medium)   
**Iteration**: 2

**Notes:**
- Lets the cleaner take holidays or sick leave if necessary
- They need set the time themselves

---

## Estimation

**Assumptions:**
- Cleaners won't try to abuse this since they set the dates themselves

**Planning Poker:**
- Casey: 3 days (Iteration 2)  
- Damon: X days (Iteration x)  
- Daniel: 2 days (Iteration 2)
- Harrison: 6 days (Iteration 1)  
**Average:** `_` days 

--------------------------

## Tasks
1. Create "request time off" screen (using the calendar) and prevent that cleaner from being scheduled during that time - 1 day
