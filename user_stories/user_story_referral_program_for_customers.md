# Referral Program for Customers

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a customer, I want to refer friends and earn rewards so I can save money on future bookings while helping others discover the platform.

## Priority
**Range:** 20 (High)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to feature deprioritization and limited scope)

**Notes:**  
- Encourages organic user growth via referrals.  
- Supports customer retention through incentives.  
- Dropped to focus on more critical service and booking features.

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Needs a referral code generation and tracking system.  
- Rewards must trigger only after referred users complete a booking.  

**Planning Poker:**
