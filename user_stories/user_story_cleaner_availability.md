# Cleaner Availability

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a customer, I want to see the real-time availability of cleaners, so I can make quick and informed booking decisions without wasting time on unavailable options.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 20 (High)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to project scope and velocity constraints)

**Notes:**  
- Improves booking efficiency by showing when cleaners are available.  
- Helps reduce frustration and failed bookings.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 planning in favour of higher-priority functionality like booking creation and reliability scores.

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Requires backend logic to track availability and sync with the UI in real-time.  
- May need cleaner-side controls to update availability.  

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: 4 days  
- Damon: 3 days  
- Casey: 2 days  
- Daniel: 3 days  
- **Average:** 3 days

## Tasks (Not Implemented)
1. Create a real-time availability tracking system — 2 days  
2. Integrate availability data into front-end UI — 1 day  

**Total estimated time: 3 days**
