# Cleaning Supplies Tracking

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a cleaner, I want to track my cleaning supplies, so I can make sure I have what I need for each job and easily request restocks when running low.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 30 (Medium)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to project scope and velocity limitations)

**Notes:**  
- Helps cleaners manage inventory efficiently and avoid delays.  
- Potential to expand with vendor integrations for automatic restocking.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 to prioritise booking and reliability features.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Requires a logging system for supply usage.  
- Alerts would notify cleaners of low inventory.  
- Restock requests could optionally notify admin or vendors.

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: 7 days  
- Damon: 6 days  
- Casey: 8 days  
- Daniel: 6 days  
- **Average:** 7 days

## Tasks (Not Implemented)
1. Implement supply tracking system for cleaners — 1.5 days  
2. Add low-supply alerts and notifications — 1 day  
3. Enable supply restock requests via the app — 0.5 day  

**Total estimated time: 3 days**
