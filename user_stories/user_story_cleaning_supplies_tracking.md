# Cleaning Supplies Tracking

## Description
**Description-v1:**  
As a cleaner, I want to track my cleaning supplies so that I can ensure I have the necessary materials for each job and request restocks when needed.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 30 (Medium)  
**Iteration:** 2  

**Notes:**  
- Helps cleaners manage their inventory efficiently.  
- Prevents job delays due to missing supplies.  
- Can be extended to integrate with supply vendors for automatic restocking.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Requires a tracking system where cleaners can log their supply usage.  
- Optionally integrates with inventory alerts when supplies run low.  

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: 7 days (Iteration 2)  
- Damon: X days (Iteration X)  
- Casey: 3 days (Iteration 2)  
- Daniel: 6 days (Iteration 2)  
- **Average:** X days
