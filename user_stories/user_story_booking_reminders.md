# Booking Reminders

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a customer, I want to receive booking reminders before my scheduled cleaning, so I don’t forget my appointment and can stay organized.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 20 (High)  
**Iteration:** Originally planned for Iteration 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to scope and velocity constraints)

**Notes:**  
- Would help reduce no-shows and last-minute cancellations.  
- Ensures both customers and cleaners stay on schedule.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 planning due to time limitations and focus on higher-priority features.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Would require a scheduling/notification system.  
- Customers would be able to select when to receive reminders.

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: 4 days  
- Damon: 5 days  
- Casey: 6 days  
- Daniel: 5 days  
- **Average:** 5 days
