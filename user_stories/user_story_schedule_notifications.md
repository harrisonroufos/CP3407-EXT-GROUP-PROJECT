## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a cleaner, I want to be swiftly notified when a new cleaning job is added to my schedule so I can stay informed and prepare accordingly.

## Priority
**Range:** 40 (Low)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to scope trimming for core features)

**Notes:**  
- Sends push notifications to cleaners about new schedule additions.  
- Useful for cleaners with consistent job assignments.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 due to lower impact relative to other priorities.

- Damon: 4 days  
- Daniel: 1 day  
- Harrison: 6 days
