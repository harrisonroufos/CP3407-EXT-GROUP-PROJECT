# Chat with Hired Cleaner

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a customer, I want to chat with my hired cleaner through the app, so I can communicate without giving out my personal phone number.

## Priority
**Range:** 50 (Low)  
**Iteration:** Originally considered for future scope 
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to project scope and user preference for external apps)

**Notes:**  
- Centralizes communication within the platform.  
- Optional feature — many users may prefer face-to-face or existing messaging apps.  
- Dropped to focus on higher-impact features with limited development time.
