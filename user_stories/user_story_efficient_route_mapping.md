# Efficient Route Mapping

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a cleaner, I want a feature that maps out the most efficient route between jobs and alerts me to any changes or cancellations, so I can manage my time and energy effectively throughout the day.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 40 (Low)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to project scope and complexity)

**Notes:**  
- Valuable for time management and minimizing travel fatigue.  
- Especially useful for cleaners with multiple bookings per day.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 due to complexity and focus on more core features.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Integration with mapping services (e.g., Google Maps API) is required.  
- Feature must support real-time route adjustments based on job cancellations or changes.

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: 10 days  
- Damon: 8 days  
- Casey: 11 days  
- Daniel: 10 days  
- **Average:** 10 days

## Tasks (Not Implemented)
1. Research and integrate mapping API — 2 days  
2. Develop route optimization logic — 2 days  
3. Implement alert system for updates and cancellations — 2 days  

**Total estimated time: 6 days**

## Completed  
❌ This feature was not implemented.  
It was deprioritized due to technical complexity and limited development time in Iteration 2.
