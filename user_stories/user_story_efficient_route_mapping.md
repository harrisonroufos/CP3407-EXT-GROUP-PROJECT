# Efficient Route Mapping

## Description
**Description-v1:**  
As a cleaner, I want a feature that maps out the most efficient route between jobs and alerts me to any changes or cancellations.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 40 (LOW)  
**Iteration:** 1  

**Notes:**  
- Critical for improving time management and reducing fatigue for cleaners.  
- High value for solo cleaners managing multiple jobs in a day.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Requires integration with a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps).  
- Needs real-time update functionality for route changes or cancellations.  

**Planning Poker:**  
- Harrison: X days (Iteration X)  
- Damon: 7 days (Iteration 1)  
- Casey: 11 days (Iteration 2)
- Daniel: 10 days (Iteration 2)
- **Average:** X days
