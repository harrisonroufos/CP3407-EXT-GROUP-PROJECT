Create more md files like this one as needed. Place them into the same folder
as this [user_stories](./) folder. <br> Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

# User story title | e.g. `Show current deals`
User stories: Describe one thing the software needs to do for the customer.
> - Write using language that the user can understand and short. <br>
> - Written from the customerâ€™s point of view.
> - Each user story can only represent a *single* feature alone.
> - Very short, few words `title`.

## Priority | `Range` & `Iteration` (See instructions below)
> - Range including 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50, with 10 being the most significant, and 50 being the least.
> - Each user story should belong to an iteration where it is intended to be developed and shipped. The exact date is to be decided as a team later.

**Notes:**
> Any notes on why you have this priority go here. E.g.
> - Did you think it was easy?
> - Is this a foundational feature?
> - How important was this to the client? etc.
- *Example note goes here*
- ...
 
(Please keep in mind that you may have different priorities at different stages of your project. Again, keep all changes here for marking purposes.

## Estimation (Part 1) | `number of days` (See instructions below)
This step is to be completed without the client and as a development team. You must now share how long each member estimates each user story (feature) to implement. <br>
This is done by playing a *'Planning Poker'* game, where everyone selects an amount of time they believe a feature will take to implement. Rules:
> - Everyone must reveal their selection at the same time.
> - `number of days` can span from (1-100) days.
> - Any amount of days over 50 indicates that a team member is requesting the assumptions to be checked.
> - If the average of all team members' selections is over 15 days, the user story will likely need to be broken down into smaller logical parts.

**Assumptions:**
Write down your assumptions related to implementing the feature that could alter how long it takes, before making an overall time estimate.
- *Example assumption goes here*
- ...

**Planning Poker:**
All notes related to overall time estimates go here. Keep a log of your *'Planning Poker'* games here.
> Format: `Team member name`: `estimate` (`iteration)`
* Bob: 1 day (Iteration 1)
* Casey: ...
* Harrison: ...
* Damon: ...
* Daniel: ...

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Task 1, Estimation XX days
2. ...


# UI Design:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
