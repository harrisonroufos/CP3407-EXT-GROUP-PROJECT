## Description

As a cleaner, I want to be notified of all other cleaners using the app who are currently working in my area.

---

## Priority 

**Range**: 50 (Very Low)    
**Iteration**: 3

**Notes:**
- Could be a neat social element to see where other cleaners are working
- Makes accidental or double-bookings less likely
- Cleaners need to explicitly tell the app to use their location for this feature
- Similar to snapchat snap map?

---

## Estimation

**Assumptions:**
- Location is kept secure
- Won't be used to track people
- This will be a feature people are looking for

**Planning Poker:**
- Casey: 6 days (Iteration 2)  
- Damon: X days (Iteration x)  
- Daniel: 2 days (Iteration 2)
- Harrison: X days (Iteration X)  
**Average:** `_` days
