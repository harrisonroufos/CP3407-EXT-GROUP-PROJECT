# See Current Area Cleaning Jobs

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a cleaner, I want to see a map of other cleaners currently working nearby (with their consent), so I can avoid double bookings and get a sense of activity in my area.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 50 (Very Low)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to scope and privacy concerns)

**Notes:**  
- Adds a light social element similar to Snap Map.  
- Helps prevent accidental double bookings.  
- Location sharing is opt-in only.  
- Dropped due to privacy complexity and low user impact.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Users must opt-in to share location.  
- Data will be used responsibly and won't allow tracking.  
- Feature may have novelty but limited adoption.

**Planning Poker:**  
- Casey: 6 days  
- Damon: 6 days  
- Daniel: 8 days  
- Harrison: 6 days  
- **Average:** 6.5 days

## Tasks (Not Implemented)
