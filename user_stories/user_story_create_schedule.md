# Create Schedule

## Description

As a cleaner, I want to create a schedule to mark when I'm available.

---

## Priority 

**Range**: 30 (Medium)   
**Iteration**: 2

**Notes:**
- Lets the cleaner take holidays or sick leave if necessary
- They need set the time themselves

---

## Estimation

**Assumptions:**
- Cleaners won't try to abuse this since they set the dates themselves

**Planning Poker:**
- Casey: 3 days (Iteration 2)  
- Damon: 5 days (Iteration 2)  
- Daniel: 2 days (Iteration 2)
- Harrison: 6 days (Iteration 1)  
**Average:** 5 days (Iteration 2)  

--------------------------

## Tasks
1. Create "create schedule" screen (using the calendar) and prevent that cleaner from being scheduled outside that time - 1 day

## UI Design
*Insert a mockup screenshot of the reliability score interface.*

---

## Completed
*Insert screenshots of the completed feature's implementation.*
