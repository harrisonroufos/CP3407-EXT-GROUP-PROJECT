# Create Schedule

## Description
**Description-v2:**  
As a cleaner, I want to create a personal schedule to set my availability, so I can manage my work around holidays, sick leave, or other commitments.

---

## Priority
**Range:** 30 (Medium)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Status:** ❌ Dropped (due to limited development time and scope constraints)

**Notes:**  
- Gives cleaners control over their availability.  
- Reduces accidental bookings during unavailable times.  
- Dropped during Iteration 2 planning in favour of core booking and rating features.

---

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Cleaners are expected to manage their own time responsibly.  
- Requires calendar-based input and integration with booking logic.

**Planning Poker:**  
- Casey: 3 days  
- Damon: 5 days  
- Daniel: 2 days  
- Harrison: 6 days  
- **Average:** 4 days

## Tasks (Not Implemented)
