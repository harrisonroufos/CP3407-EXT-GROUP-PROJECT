# Iteration 2 Plan

We have changed the velocity based on Iteration 1 outcome. We were able to complete 16.5 days of user stories, which is about 0.2 velocity.

We also restructured the Iteration 2 plan based on these findings. A new user story was created: "Create Booking" — a critical feature that was originally overlooked.

## Assumptions:
> - 4 weeks per iteration  
> - 20 business days per iteration  
> - 0.2 velocity (team efficiency)  
> - 4 developers  
> - `Total Development Days` = 20 x 0.2 x 4 = 16 days
