# Iteration 1 plan
Assume:
> - 4 weeks per iteration
> - 20 business days per iteration
> - 0.4 velocity (team efficiency)
> - 4 developers 
> - `Total Development Days` = `business days per iteration` x `velocity` x `number of developers`
> - Total = 20 x 0.4 x 4

Hence, there are 32 days worth of user story development per iteration.

## Breakdown:
> Format: `link` | `ideal days to develop` | `priority` (10 most important, 50 least)

# Iteration 2 plan
We have changed the velocity based on iteration 1 outcome.

Assume:
> - 4 weeks per iteration
> - 20 business days per iteration
> - 0.2 velocity (team efficiency)
> - 4 developers 
> - `Total Development Days` = `business days per iteration` x `velocity` x `number of developers`
> - Total = 20 x 0.25 x 4

Hence, there are 20 days worth of user story development per iteration.

### NEW Iteration 2 plan (based on iteration 1 summary)
1. [Create Booking](/user_stories/create_booking.md) | 5 days | 10
2. [Customer Feedback and Reviews](/user_stories/user_story_customer_feedback.md) | 4 days | 20
3. [Reliability Scores](/user_stories/user_story_reliability_scores.md) | 4 days | 30
4. [Job Cancellation](/user_stories/user_story_handle_cancellations.md) | 4 days | 30
   
**Estimated Time - 18.5 days**


### OLD Iteration 2
1. [Booking Reminders](/user_stories/user_story_booking_reminders.md) | 6.5 days | 20
2. [Clearner Availability](/user_stories/user_story_cleaner_availability) | 3 days | 20
3. [Recurring Job](/user_stories/user_story_recurring_job.md) | 5 days | 30
4. [Create Schedule](/user_stories/user_story_create_schedule.md) | 5 days | 30
5. [Job Cancellation](/user_stories/user_story_handle_cancellations.md) | 4 days | 30

7. [Referral Program for Customers](/user_stories/user_story_referral_program_for_customers.md) | 4 days | 50

**Estimated Time - 30.5 days**



### Dropped User Stories (Deprioritised)
* [Route Mapping](/user_stories/user_story_efficient_route_mapping.md) - Found to be outside of project scope and required too many development days for length of iteration cycle.
* [Cleaning Supplies Tracker](/user_stories/user_story_cleaning_supplies_tracking.md) - Feature deemed unnecessary; product ordering outside of scope and cleaners have personal inventory logs. 
* [Chat With Cleaner](/user_stories/user_story_chat_with_hired_cleaner.md) - Most customers will be more familiar with existing chat apps that can be outsourced for free.
* [See Current Area Jobs](/user_stories/user_story_see_current_area_cleaning_jobs.md) - Iteration development cycle is too small to effectively incorporate location-based tracking and mapping.
* [Booking Reminders](/user_stories/user_story_booking_reminders.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Clearner Availability](/user_stories/user_story_cleaner_availability) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Recurring Job](/user_stories/user_story_recurring_job.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Create Schedule](/user_stories/user_story_create_schedule.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Schedule Notifications](/user_stories/user_story_schedule_notifications.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Referral Program for Customers](/user_stories/user_story_referral_program_for_customers.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1 summary.
* [Booking Confirmation](/user_stories/user_story_booking_confirmation.md) - Due to iteration 2 re-structure from iteration 1
