### User Story 1
Harry is a cleaner working between several small local businesses. One business he cleans for has accidentally double-booked his regular time slot with a new cleaner.
Harry thinks it would be great if he either had warning that a new cleaner was coming in, or if this double-booking situation could be avoided entirely.
He wants to be notified of all other cleaning jobs in the area, and who the cleaner is for all these jobs.
