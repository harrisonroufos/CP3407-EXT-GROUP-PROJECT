### User Story 1
Harry is a cleaner working between several small local businesses. One business he cleans for has accidentally double-booked his regular time slot with a new cleaner.
Harry thinks it would be great if he either had warning that a new cleaner was coming in, or if this double-booking situation could be avoided entirely.
He wants to be notified of cleaning jobs in the area.

### User Story 2
Julia runs her own cleaning company. She consistently has issues with her current booking system, as employees often don't get notified of new cleaning jobs.
She also believes that creating schedules on her current system is cumbersome and frustrating.
Julia wants a more reliable solution with a better scheduling procedure.
