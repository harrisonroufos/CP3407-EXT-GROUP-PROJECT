# Iteration 1 plan
Assume:
> - 4 weeks per iteration
> - 20 business days per iteration
> - 0.4 velocity (team efficiency)
> - 4 developers 
> - `Total Development Days` = `business days per iteration` x `velocity` x `number of developers`
> - Total = 20 x 0.4 x 4

Hence, there are 32 days worth of user story development per iteration.

## Breakdown:
> Format: `link` | `ideal days to develop` | `priority` (10 most important, 50 least)

### Iteration 1
1. [Browse Cleaners](/user_stories/user_story_browse_cleaners.md) | 7.5 days | 10
2. [Cleaner Profile](/user_stories/user_story_create_cleaner_profile.md) | 5 days | 10
3. [Custom Cleaning Checklist](/user_stories/user_story_custom_cleaning_checklist.md) | 4 days | 20
4. [Reliability Scores](/user_stories/user_story_reliability_scores.md) | 4 days | 20
5. [Real-Time Availability](/user_stories/user_story_real_time_availability.md) | 3 days | 20
6. [Customer Feedback and Reviews](/user_stories/user_story_customer_feedback.md) | 4 days | 20

### Iteration 2
1. [Booking Confirmation and Reminders](/user_stories/user_story_booking_confirmation_and_reminders.md) | 6.5 days | 30
2. [Recurring Job](/user_stories/user_story_recurring_job.md) | 5 days | 30
3. [Create Schedule](/user_stories/user_story_create_schedule.md) | 5 days | 30
4. [Job Cancellation](/user_stories/user_story_handle_cancellations.md) | 4 days | 30
5. [Schedule Notifications](/user_stories/user_story_schedule_notifications.md) | 3 days | 40
6. [Referral Program for Customers](/user_stories/user_story_referral_program_for_customers.md) | 4 days | 50

### Dropped User Stories (Deprioritised)
* [Route Mapping](/user_stories/user_story_efficient_route_mapping.md) - Found to be outside of project scope and required too many development days for length of iteration cycle.
* [Cleaning Supplies Tracker](/user_stories/user_story_cleaning_supplies_tracking.md) - Feature deemed unnecessary; product ordering outside of scope and cleaners have personal inventory logs. 
* [Chat With Cleaner](/user_stories/user_story_chat_with_hired_cleaner.md) - Most customers will be more familiar with existing chat apps that can be outsourced for free.
* [See Current Area Jobs](/user_stories/user_story_see_current_area_cleaning_jobs.md) - Iteration development cycle is too small to effectively incorporate location-based tracking and mapping.
