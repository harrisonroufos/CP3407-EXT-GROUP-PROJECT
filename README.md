## Live Website
You can use the cloud-hosted website by visiting: [https://cp3407-myclean.onrender.com/](https://cp3407-myclean.onrender.com/)

> [!Note]  
> The website is hosted on [Render](https://render.com), a cloud-based deployment platform that connects 'MyClean' application with an external Postgre 16.0, Oregon (US West) database.
> Because Render puts inactive sites to sleep to save resources, the site may take **10‚Äì30 seconds** to start when accessed for the first time.

> Alternatively: <br>
> Open the code in a local environment, run `app.py`, and visit the local IP shown in the terminal.
>  
> The application is built using Flask (Python) and is deployed as a full-stack web service. It connects directly to a managed PostgreSQL database, also hosted on Render.
> This enables full functionality, including user login, profile management, and data storage, without requiring any local setup.

> [!Important]
> The local environment offers a toggle between a local testing database and the production cloud-hosted one. You can toggle between using them by changing the value of `USE_LOCAL_DB` by following the path `Backend/services/.env`. This feature was used frequently for testing purposes throughout development.

## Project Requirements & User Stories (Criteria 1)

This project involved planning and documenting a large number of user stories across multiple iterations. Each story
includes:

- Polished and standardised formatting
- Prioritisation (range 1‚Äì50)
- Planning poker estimations
- Assigned iteration (1, 2, or dropped)
- UI mockups (even for dropped stories)

## üñºÔ∏è Interface Design & UI Mockups

All designs (including those for dropped features) can be seen and compared within the [Interface Designs](major_component_designs/interface_designs.md) directory.  
Each mockup is linked within its respective user story, but this allows you to browse them all in one place.

**Examples include:**

- Cleaner Availability wireframe
- Custom Cleaning Checklist builder
- Cancel Booking interface
- Recurring Job scheduler
- Snap Map-style Nearby Cleaners view
- Referral Program screen
- Cleaning Supplies tracker
- Schedule Notifications alert view

## üß™ Testing

We implemented comprehensive testing using `pytest` across all major components of the system. They can be found in the [Tests](/tests) directory. Our tests cover:

### ‚úÖ Structure

- **Shared Fixtures**: All common test setup (e.g. test users, cleaners, bookings, and client) is located in
  `conftest.py` to reduce duplication and ensure consistent teardown between test runs.

- **Modular Test Files**:
    - `test_app.py`: General application behavior, login, and booking management.
    - `test_booking.py`: Booking creation, route access (GET/POST), and deletion.
    - `test_cleaner.py`: Cleaner profile view and profile editing.
    - `test_database.py`: Validates DB connection, table setup, and seed data (e.g. admin user).
    - `test_services.py`: Tests service functions like booking date formatting.

### ‚úÖ Coverage

- **Route testing**:
    - Login with valid credentials
    - Booking creation and deletion
    - Profile editing and retrieval
    - Auth protection for protected routes

- **Error conditions**:
    - Access denied if not logged in
    - Invalid cleaner or booking ID

- **Backend services**:
    - Date formatting for booking display

- **Database logic**:
    - Verifies tables exist after init
    - Confirms admin account is seeded properly
